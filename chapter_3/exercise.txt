3.1 Suppose I show you a call stack like this.
What information can you give me, just based on this call stack?

-name

3.2 Suppose you accidentally write a recursive function that runs 
forever. As you saw, your computer allocates memory on the 
stack for each function call. What happens to the stack when your 
recursive function runs forever?

-memory overflow
